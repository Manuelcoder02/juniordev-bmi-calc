              Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our
              body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole
              determinant of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting
              point to evaluate your overall health and well-being.

              <h3>What your BMI result means</h3>
              <p>
                A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.'
                Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of
                experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2
                diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar
                content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables.
                Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally
                about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

          <h3>Limitations of BMI</h3>
          <p class="limit">
            Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is
            not suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully
            consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement
            may not be beneficial to use.

              </div>
              <p>
                The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary
                with age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered
                when evaluating their BMI.

                <h4>Age</h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may
                cause BMI to underestimate body fat content.

              </div>
              <p>
                BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese,
                as it doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.

              </div>
              <p>
                Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing

                minimise health risks for both mother and child.

                advised to discuss this with your GP or practice nurse.
